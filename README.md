Abstract
The technological advancement has necessitated the need for more robust encryption techniques as cyber threats evolve. Security in cloud storage is still an issue, especially in the areas of data privacy and authentication. The proposed system is an enhanced encryption scheme combining two custom S-Box techniques with HMAC  detection to improve Cloud Storage protection. The proposed architecture considers three main concerns: Data Owners, Data Users, and Trusted Authority. The system is based on the Dual Custom S-Box Algorithm, which provides additional strength of encryption by creating user-specific S-Boxes, making it unpredictable and complex. The trusted authority handles all aspects of user manipulation, including activation, deactivation, and secure key distribution. Moreover, HMAC with the SHA-256 algorithm ensures data preservation upon storage. This combination seeks to enhance the confidentiality, integrity, and access control of the data in the cloud environment which is a limitation of the existing systems.
